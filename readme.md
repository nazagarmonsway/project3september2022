i can also use href to call an external css file
order of css matters

anchor tag is an in line element
paragraph is a block element, as is h1

div and span. div is a block element. span is an inline element

wrap inlines in inlines (i.e. <anchor tags inside span tags) you can also wrap inlines in block (ie div) but it will treat the styling like a blovk element. can not wrap blocks in inline.
